# Dan Tello
_Senior Front-End Developer at [Viget](https://www.viget.com/) (6+ years)_


**Ex-graphic designer who fell in love with code.** Dan's been creating for web since he was 12, starting with the premier developer tool of the day: Microsoft Word '97. He's since traded in WordArt and rainbow gradients for a terminal and text editor, but his appreciation for (and undergraduate degree in) graphic design still shine through.

He spends his time building fast and accessible JavaScript applications (React.js ❤), collaborating with visual and UX designers, and tweaking build tools.

## Selected Work Samples

### Avalon
Lead JS/Front-End Developer on a collaborative network graph editing tool for cyber security analysts. I helped take the product from white board concepts to a fully viable product with close collaboration with our the client's back-end developer and members of our UX and Design team. 

React + Microcosm (flux) app backed by WebSockets a Django REST API. The interactive network graph visualization is built on top of Vis.js.


### Privia Medical Group
Lead JS/Front-End Developer building a new coordinated patient health care management platform for Privia health care management teams. Helped push the development team from a traditional Rails view-based solution towards React.js. Having a unidirectional data flow and a component based system allowed us to build much more complex and elegant user experience, all with a maintainable code base built to scale. Forms were a big part of the interface, so I built a robust form component library to allow back-end devs to easily create consistent form layouts with proper styling, error handling, and data submission with minimal markup.

React + Microcosm (flux) app backed by Rails JSON API. 

### Post Creator
https://www.postcreator.com/

Lead JS/Front-End Developer building a social media graphic creation and posting tool that can simultaneously post content to multiple destinations. We took the client's idea from white board to product.

Backbone.js (dark days), Create.js, Rails.

### Run Puma Run
Collaborated with a Designer on an 8-bit style infinite runner game built for Puma.com during the 2012 Summer Olympics. One of my favorite projects of all time :) Featured as a [FWA site of the day](https://thefwa.com/cases/run-puma-run).

JavaScript + canvas, no libraries! Created 100% original sound effects in Garage Band. Soundtrack is stock.

## Open Source Work

### [Blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter)
<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter" data-icon="octicon-star" data-style="mega" data-count-href="/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/stargazers" data-count-api="/repos/vigetlabs/gulp-starter#stargazers_count" data-count-aria-label="# stargazers on GitHub" aria-label="Star vigetlabs/gulp-starter on GitHub">Star</a>

Formerly known as "Gulp Starter". A delicious blend of gulp tasks combined into a configurable asset pipeline and static site builder. Strings together compiling Webpack 2 (with Babel and hot-module replacement), Node Sass, BrowserSync, SVG Sprite creation, HTML templating (Nunjucks) and other assets together into a single package with minimal configuration. 

Used internally at Viget on most of our projects. Grew steadily out of ideas from my [Gulp + Browserify](https://www.viget.com/articles/gulp-browserify-starter-faq) blog post in 2014.

### [Ca11y](https://github.com/vigetlabs/ca11y)
A lightweight accessible dependency-free datepicker. Keyboard accessible with special attention to Apple Voiceover dictation.

### [inline-svg-sprite](https://github.com/vigetlabs/inline-svg-sprite)
Inlines external svgs sprites and updates `xlink:href` attributes in `<use>` tags to reference the inlined svg. Created when some shortcomings of [svg4Everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) surfaced on a project. 

Primarily for Internet Explorer compatibility with external SVG sprites.
