**Ex-graphic designer who fell in love with code.** I've been creating for the web since age 12, starting with the premier developer tool of the day: Microsoft Word '97. I've since traded in WordArt and rainbow gradients for a terminal and text editor, but my appreciation for (and undergraduate degree in) graphic design still shine through.

At work, I spend my time building fast and accessible JavaScript applications (React.js ‚ù§), collaborating with visual and UX designers, and tweaking [build tools](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid).

## Selected Work ü¶Ñ

### Avalon
Lead JS/Front-End Developer on a collaborative network graph editing tool for cyber security analysts. I helped take the product from white board concepts to a fully featured product with close collaboration with our the client's back-end developer and members of our UX and Design team. 

![Avalon Demo](images/avalon-demo.gif)

React.js + Microcosm.js (flux) app backed by WebSockets a Django REST API. The interactive network graph visualization is built on top of Vis.js.


### Privia Medical Group
Lead JS/Front-End Developer building a new coordinated patient health care management platform for Privia health care management teams. Helped push the development team from a traditional Rails view-based solution towards React.js. Having a unidirectional data flow and a component based system allowed us to build much more complex and elegant user experience, all with a maintainable code base built to scale. 

![Privia Demo](images/privia-demo.gif)

Forms were a big part of the interface, so I built a robust React component library to allow back-end devs to easily create consistent form layouts with proper styling, error handling, and data submission with minimal markup.

React.js + Microcosm.js (flux) app backed by Rails JSON API 

### Post Creator

Lead JS/Front-End Developer building a social media graphic creation and posting tool that can simultaneously post content to multiple destinations. We took the client's idea from white board to product.

While it didn't start as a mobile-focused product, we did end up adapting it for small screens.

Backbone.js üíÄ, Create.js, Ruby on Rails

### Run Puma Run
Collaborated with a Designer on an 8-bit style infinite runner game built for Puma.com during the 2012 Summer Olympics. One of my favorite projects of all time :) Featured as a [FWA site of the day](https://thefwa.com/cases/run-puma-run).

[![Run Puma Run](images/run-puma-run.gif)](http://code.viget.com/run-puma-run)

JavaScript + canvas ‚Äî no libraries! Created original sound effects in Garage Band. [Click to play!](code.viget.com/run-puma-run)

## Open Source Projects <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png" width="24"/>

### Blendid

A delicious blend of gulp tasks combined into a configurable asset pipeline and static site builder.

![Blendid Logo](images/blendid-logo.png)

Strings together compiling Webpack 2 (with Babel and hot-module replacement), Node Sass, BrowserSync, SVG Sprite creation, HTML templating (Nunjucks) and other assets together into a single package with minimal configuration. 

<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter" data-icon="octicon-star" data-style="mega" data-count-href="/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/stargazers" data-count-api="/repos/vigetlabs/gulp-starter#stargazers_count" data-count-aria-label="# stargazers on GitHub" aria-label="Star vigetlabs/gulp-starter on GitHub">Star</a>

This is Viget's most popular open source project, and used on most of our client work. Grew steadily out of ideas from my [Gulp + Browserify](https://www.viget.com/articles/gulp-browserify-starter-faq) blog post in 2014.

### Ca11y

A lightweight, dependency-free, keyboard accessible datepicker with special attention to Apple Voiceover dictation.

### inline-svg-sprite
Inlines external svgs sprites and updates `xlink:href` attributes in `<use>` tags to reference the inlined svg. Created when some shortcomings of [svg4Everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) surfaced on a project. 

Primarily for Internet Explorer compatibility with external SVG sprites.

## Writing ‚úèÔ∏è

### Viget.com
Without blog posts, stack overflow, and Google, I wouldn't be the developer I am today. I have learned so much because others took the time to publish what they've learned to a url. When time permits, I try to give back and add to the collective knowledge from which I built a career.
